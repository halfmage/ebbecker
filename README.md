# Ute Becker Nutrition Consultant

A website I made for a nutrition consultant from germany I wanted to open source since it uses a lot of cool features from the TEA-Stack (TailwindCSS, Eleventy, and AlpineJS). With focus in performance I included the `@11ty/eleventy-img` plugin to give a huge bonus on page build and render time.

- **EleventyJS** for static site generator
- **TailwindCSS** for styling including a config
- **AlpineJS** for simple javascript click events
- **@11ty/eleventy-img** + **sharp** for image optimization
- **html-minifier** to minify html source code

### Get started

```js
npm install // install dependecies
npm run build // only first time
npm run start // eleventy magic âœ¨
```
