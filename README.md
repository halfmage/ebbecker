# Ute Becker Nutrition Consultant

A website I made for a nutrition consultant from germany I wanted to open source since it uses a lot of cool features from the TEA-Stack (TailwindCSS, Eleventy, and AlpineJS). With focus in performance I included the `@11ty/eleventy-img` plugin to give a huge bonus on page build and render time.

### Get started

```
npm install

npm run build // only first time

npm run start
```
